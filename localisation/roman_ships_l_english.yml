    START_SCREEN_ROME:0 "The Roman Empire stands alone, victorious against all who would challenge the chosen descendants of Mars.  Centuries of expansion and conflict have at long last brought all the lands of Earth under Imperial dominion, fully realizing the age of Terra Roma.  A nation without frontiers is, however, a restless and uncertain thing.\n\nWith the worlds of Sol charted and the last holdouts of the Qin and Mongols long defeated, the people of Rome look to their Imperator for new direction and purpose.  Now, in the twenty-second century since the founding of the Eternal City, the path to the stars has at last been found. Whatever trials await the Empire in this new frontier only the Fates may know, but by the grace of Fortune and the will of Mars, Rome shall eagerly meet all that might challenge it.\n\nROMA INVICTUS"
