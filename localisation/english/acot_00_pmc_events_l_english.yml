acot_pmc.0.title: "Unidentified Contact Detected!"
acot_pmc.0.desc: "[root.GetName] has detected a large installation owned by an unknown faction within the space of [from.GetName]. The unknown fleets and starbases appear to be neutral, their weapons all aimed at our ships but not powered. The ships they used seem to have extremely advanced designs that we cannot identify. But the most shocking sight is that the star of this system appears to have been trapped within a titanic-sized spacecraft. Whoever controls this system must possess extremely ancient and powerful technologies."
acot_pmc.0.a: "We should attempt to decipher their languages and communications." #Non phobe
acot_pmc.0.b: "Another dangerous alien..." #phobe
acot_pmc.0.c: "We do not care who they are, they will die eventually." #Dumb Purifiers
acot_pmc.0.d: "This will not be an easy prey." #Discount Tyranid
acot_pmc.0.e: "But are they organics?" #Edgebots
 
acot_pmc.diplo_title: "Phanon Corps"
 
acot_pmc.1.desc: "Welcome traveller, to the Phanon Corps's base of operations. I am Urimurich Und Zorihs, or what the people love to call me The Legendary Smuggler. I have taken the liberty of uploading my organization's languages into your translation software so that you don't have to do that yourself. You must be wondering what are we doing here, we are a private military company, or a mercenary for hire. Unlike those marauder losers, we actually have the technologies, manpower and resource to be a legitimate business and we don't strap thrusters on every asteroids and call them a ship.\n\nUnfortunately, our foothold on this galaxy is still being set up, so we cannot provide most of our services yet. Sorry for the inconvenience. Feel free to take a look around, I will upload all survey datas of this system for you since watching you spend an entire year doing it can be annoying sometimes."
acot_pmc.1.a: "Hello there." ## NONP  HOBE
acot_pmc.1.b: "Very well." ## PHOBE
acot_pmc.1.purifier.a: "We won't conduct business with xenos."
acot_pmc.1.purifier.a.response: "Won't you? That's too bad, and here I thought we'd be the bestest of friends. Did your god tell you not to? The same god every single religious folks in this galaxy seem to worship somehow.\n\nI don't really care either way. But know that my forces will not hesitate to return fire should you try to attack us."
acot_pmc.1.swarm.a: "We do not interact with food."
acot_pmc.1.swarm.a.response: "Too bad this food can be quite poisonous to eat. But hey, you are a devouring swarm, it's not like you're going to learn to be civilized or anything. The option has already been removed from you by something that you cannot possibly be aware of. Keep your antidotes close.\n\nI don't really care either way. But know that my forces will not hesitate to return fire should you try to attack us."
acot_pmc.1.exterminator.a: "You are an organic. You cannot be trusted."
acot_pmc.1.exterminator.a.response: "Of course I cannot be trusted, I am a Smuggler.\n\nAlthough I don't think anyone can be trusted anyway. Can you trust your own directives? Are you sure you're not doing this because some dumb scientists or admirals set you up? Maybe some kind of limitations were put in so that you can only respond in this way.\n\nI don't really care either way. But know that my forces will not hesitate to return fire should you try to attack us."
acot_pmc.1.insult: "<Gives the Smuggler a 25-minute long insult>"
acot_pmc.1.insult.tooltip: "Such a sickening lifeform has no place setting up a base in this galaxy. They are nothing but just a glorified pirates, who probably just paint everything red to look edgy. Legendary Smuggler? What's so legendary about smuggling? We are the Legend, We are the one who will remove this teenage boy from the galaxy that rightfully belong to us. And then we will keep all his toys, since he clearly sucks at using them."
acot_pmc.1.purifier.insult.response: "Whoa, who wrote you this script? 25-minute rants about how awesome sauce you are and how super great your god is. I am sorry to tell you, there are only one group of gods in this galaxy, and they are no longer here...for now anyway. And they're going to be super pissed once they return and see your kind. As fun as that'd be, it'd make it harder for me to clean up afterwards, maybe I should just do the job for them?\n\nNah, too lazy and too much work. I'll just blow up everything you try to send into my base then!"
acot_pmc.1.swarm.insult.response: "I don't usually see someone rant so much about food for over 25 minutes. Are you sure you are a Hive Mind and not just hungry? Do you know there's another like you that became such a bad boy they get hunted across multiple galaxies and have to run like scared little babies? Would you like me to introduce them so you can share your experiences?\n\nOr maybe I'll just blow any of your ships that enter my space, since I am busy...smuggling...things at the moment <A sound of someone playing a video game can be heard>"
acot_pmc.1.exterminator.insult.response: "<Beep Boop> I am an edgebot. I am here to take an extermination job and kill all organics <boop> I cannot be reasoned with, I cannot be trifled with. I am an edgebot. <Bloop>\n\nI am sorry, but your sensors must be not working correctly, you can't out-edge my Phanon Fleets, my entire graphical culture is full of edge. You're probably not even half as edgy as that one machine that has this edgy ambient noises and ships made out of red cubes and speaks in a very edgy tone. But if you think your fleets are better at being edgy than mine, then come and fight me, and we'll paint this red system...redder?"
 
 
 
acot_pmc.2.desc.a: "Ahoy, what do you have for me today?"
acot_pmc.2.desc.b: "What can the Phanon Corps do for you?"
acot_pmc.2.desc.c: "A customer!? Or a challenger? Well I welcome both!"
acot_pmc.2.desc.d: "Do you find my personality annoying? I was thinking maybe I should act less memery and starts trying to be more mysterious, like those illusive or government man-types. The ones with creepy themes playing everytime they are on the scene. But I hate coming up with proper dialogues for it though. And I certainly don't want to find a fitting theme for me."
acot_pmc.2.desc.e: "Despite the name, I don't actually smuggle stuff that often. Honestly I don't even know why people called me that."
 
acot_pmc.2.desc.purifier: "You again? What life lesson will you enlighten me this time?"
acot_pmc.2.desc.swarm: "Your food is not ready, please wait awhile longer."
acot_pmc.2.desc.exterminator: "The line you're seeking is currently available. Please leave a message after the beep. <Boop>"
 
acot_pmc.1.a: "I should go."

acot_pmc.2.a: "We require your services."
acot_pmc.2.a.response: "Unfortunately, the Phanon Corps service is not yet available. However, I propose an alternate solution. You see, my forces there are taking forever to set up, perhaps when you are stronger you can make them...motivated? If you manage to triumph over my forces, I'll see it to it personally that you obtain your just reward."
 
acot_pmc.2.border: "Can you open your borders?"
acot_pmc.2.border.response: "Hmm I thought I did already. You must have been a new empire that did not get screened through my welcoming message or something. Guess I will have to do it again then! Done, borders opened!"
 
 
acot_pmc.2.b: "We'll speak later."
acot_pmc.2.c: "Terminate Communications"
 
#### KEYSTONE ASK - GO TO SOFE FOR INFO
acot_pmc.2.keystone: "We need help getting a Keystone."
 
#### DARK DESIGN - GO TO DARK DESIGN

#### KEYSTONE ASK - GO TO MYSTERY OF PRECURSOR
acot_pmc.2.precursor: "We need help finding a Databank."
 
acot_pmc.2.purifier.apologize: "Actually, you seem pretty dope for a Xeno."
acot_pmc.2.purifier.apologize.response: "Of course I am. See I was right, even someone as grumpy as you can be more reasonable than those space grandpas! From now on, we are besties now! Woo!"
 
acot_pmc.2.swarm.apologize: "You are not a Food. You are useful."
acot_pmc.2.swarm.apologize.response: "Damn right I am. Even if I am a food, it'd be a pretty awesome one, probably grant you immortality or something! Now let's get back to our business!"
 
 
acot_pmc.2.exterminator.apologize: "Your form is organic. But your heart is not."
acot_pmc.2.exterminator.apologize.response: "Appearances can be deceiving, yes? Now that you catch a glimpse of who I am, terminate your...termination protocol so that we can begin converse like meme lords!"
 
 
acot_pmc.2.panada: "Panada...?"
acot_pmc.2.panda.response: "What the hell? Who told you about PANADAS? NO, THERE IS NO PANADA! NO PANADA I SAY.\n\nFine! If you want Phanon Corps service, I can maybe uhh, allow you to hire my admirals and maybe our fighter squadrons. BUT NO MORE PANADA, YOU HEAR!? THAT NAME MUST NOT BE SPOKEN."
 
 
acot_pmc.2.end.panada: "Panada!"
acot_pmc.2.end.panada.response: "WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! Yarou…[Root.GetName]!\n\nHo… mukatta kuruno ka? Nigetsu ni kono DIO ni chikazuite kuruno ka?

acot_pmc.3.desc.a: "What shall it be then?"
acot_pmc.3.desc.b: "So long as it's not about Panada..."
acot_pmc.3.desc.c: "Well, what do you have in mind then?"
acot_pmc.3.desc.d: "Fine, fine. What do you need?"
acot_pmc.3.desc.e: "Ugh, I feel so uneasy right now. The only thing I can readily provide at the moment is just the Star Chasers and the Operatives.\n\nKinda bad for my reputations, you know?"
 
acot_pmc.3.a: "Can we get a squadron of Star Chasers then?"
acot_pmc.3.a.response: "Building...\n\nUnit Ready.\n\nStar Chaser Squadron reporting."
 
acot_pmc.3.b: "Can we get an admiral operative then?"
acot_pmc.3.b.response: "Training...\n\nUnit Ready.\n\nOperative, ready for service."
 
 
 
acot_pmc.10.desc: "Hou...You're coming to attack me? Instead of staying neutral, you decide to open fire on my fleets? Even though your sensors told you that my fleets are full of skulls like that one empire who just insert skulls into everything in their designs to tell you how awesome they are?"
acot_pmc.10.a: "We cannot steal your stuff without attacking."
acot_pmc.10.a.response: "HOU HOU! Then attack me as much as you like!"
 
acot_pmc.12.a.desc: "I am sorry to say but this battle appears to be one-sided. So much so I don't even have the motivation to pull off another jojokes."
acot_pmc.12.a: "That was not even enough to hurt our empire as a whole."
acot_pmc.12.a.response: "Why are you galaxy-bound empires so stubborn about admitting defeat? Hmph, I suppose I shall rise to your silly provocation, and test you just a bit more."
 
acot_pmc.11.b.desc: "Too slow! Too slow!\n\nPhanon Corps is the ultimate paramilitary. Even without my superweapons, the Phanon Fleet's speed and power far exceed that of your ships!"
acot_pmc.11.b: "So it's the same type of tech as Enigmatic..."
acot_pmc.11.b.explain: "Not much variety, but immense firepower and precise accuracy."
acot_pmc.11.b.response: "I wanted to try a little test to find out just how much more powerful my Phanon Technology is, compared to your weapons. Though it would appear a test was hardly necessary."
 
acot_pmc.12.c.desc: "It appears our firepowers are evenly matched!\n\nSo much so I don't even have time to prepare a Jojo reference anymore! This is a surprise! Not many empires grapse the knowledge of Stellarite!"
acot_pmc.12.c: "Grapses? We mastered it!"
acot_pmc.12.c.response: "If only that were true. Your Sigma Weapons and Components are indeed powerful, but it is far away from what Stellarite could truly offer you if you know its true potential!"
