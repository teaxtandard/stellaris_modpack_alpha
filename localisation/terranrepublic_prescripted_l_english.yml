 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humantr:0 "Terran Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humantr_desc:0 "Centuries of conflict on the moon-planet Auraxis has hardened the battle-weary Terran Republic into a brutal empire. What began as an enlightened and transparent democracy was transformed by a bloody civil war into a staunch martial society ruled by a centralised military dictatorship. After finally wrestling control of Auraxis from a treacherous rebel conglomerate and a sovereign technocrat cult, the Republic can now refocus its efforts on rebuilding Terran civilization and exploring the galaxy.\n\nAdvanced 'nanite' technology means that Terrans can live incredibly extended lives, so long as they remain near the ancient Vanu ruins of Auraxis where they can be reborn. Their war-weary veterans are a solitary people who have known only war, making the Terran Republic a dangerous and difficult neighbor."
 START_SCREEN_TR:0 "In our distant past, the mysterious appearance of a wormhole near Earth launched the greatest spacefaring mission in Terran history - an attempt to colonise a new world. Led by the explorer Tom Connery, the fleet of 75,000 scientists, soldiers, and colonists became stranded on the moon-planet of Auraxis after the wormhole to the Sol system collapsed without warning. Hope of our return to Earth was forever shattered, numbed only by the discovery of mysterious alien artifacts on Auraxis, left by an alien race dubbed the 'Vanu.' The miraculous 'nanite' techology was reverse-engineered, allowing for both vehicles and entire organisms to be reformed perfectly, and individuals to be reborn indefinitely in 'spawning chambers,' even after death.\n\nTragically, the discovery of Vanu technology led to a bloody civil war the likes of which Humanity has never seen before.\n\nOnly through centuries of warfare, with our superiour strategies, tactics, and military tradition, did our glorious Republic emerge victorious over the rebels and crush them once and for all.\n\nWe now look skywards to continue our great mission; to colonise new worlds and expand our borders - for the glory of the Terran Republic. Loyalty Until Death, Strength in Unity."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_human_NC:0 "New Conglomerate"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_human_NC_desc:0 "Despite initial success in colonising Auraxis, many in the Terran Republic began to question the ever-increasing restrictions on upon basic freedoms. First, it was 'quarantine' in the colonies. Then it was martial law. Then the abolishment of the vote. Then confiscations of property and brutal conscription into the military. Those who valued liberty had seen enough, and took up arms against the despotic Terran Republic. With the full financial backing of banking and industrial corporations behind them, ex-PMC and Terran military personnel soon flocked to join what would become the New Conglomerate - a merger of private corporations with a powerful army.\n\nThe New Conglomerate waged a fight for freedom and invidual rights against the tyranny of the Terran Republic. Ultimately, the conflict on Auraxis began to look grim, especially with the mysterious departure of the Vanu. A desperate, suicidal last stand at The Crown allowed for thousands of modified space-faring Galaxy transports to escape the surface of Auraxis, and settle on a distant, dusty planet dubbed 'Higby's Redoubt.' The New Conglomerate has flourished in their new homeland, and have finally had a taste of true freedom - seperate from the Terran Republic. They have now redoubled their efforts to construct a powerful military and expand their territory, and build a truly powerful nation."
 START_SCREEN_NC:0 "The Republic enslaved our people. They forced us into chains, stole our property, taxed us into poverty, and controlled every aspect of our lives. Well, screw 'em. We've finally left behind the hellish nightmare that was Auraxis. We can truly live in liberty, free from any overgrown tyrants dictating our lives. We have built new industries and a new life here - any should anyone threaten it, well, they will find out just how much we value our independence. After all, a miserable free man is better off than a contented slave. Freedom Through Force, Freedom Over Oppression!"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_human_VS:0 "Vanu Sovereignty"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_human_VS_desc:0 "The discovery of mysterious alien ruins ushered forth the beginnings of a transhumanist enlightenment on the planet Auraxis. Terran scientists studying the technologically advanced 'Vanu' ruins made rapid advancements in practically every field imaginable - from anti-gravity technology to 'nanites' capable of rebirthing dead humans indefinitely. What could have been a golden age of humanity quickly dissolved into a bitter, endless civil war. Scientists and colonists studying the Vanu broke free from the Terran Republic, determined to continue their studies unhindered by the brutal and short-sighted dictatorship that the Republic had become. Using their newfound Vanu technology, they formed the 'Vanu Sovereignty,' fighting with devastatingly advanced weapons vastly surpassing the potential of more conventional Terran armaments.\n\nAfter centuries conflict, the Vanu Sovereignty finally reverse-engineered enough technology to build a colony fleet capable of intersystem travel. Leaving behind the tyrannical and backwards Terran Republic, the scientists and faithful of the Vanu found a lush, green world, suitable of a massive settlement. Even greater was the discovery of new Vanu ruins on the planet, swelling the already fanatic faithful of the Vanu, and ensuring their destiny would continue."
 START_SCREEN_VS:0 "Vanu smiles upon us. We have been granted the gift. Our path towards enlightenment continues, and we shall overcome anyone - or anything - that stands in our way. Our superior technological might and the will of Vanu will spread across the galaxy, and uplift all life to the transcendant knowledge that Vanu offers. Should any resist, they will quickly learn the first truth of Vanu: Technology Equals Might."
